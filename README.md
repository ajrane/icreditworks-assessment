# iCreditWorks Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the iCreditWorks assessment. The project converts a Figma design into a responsive HTML/CSS layout

## Assumptions

- **Responsive Breakpoints:**  
  Optimized the design for three target resolutions:
  - **Large Desktop:** 1920×1080 (or 1920×1077 as specified)
  - **Desktop:** 1440×900
  - **Small Desktop:** 1280×800 
  - **Mobile View:** 375

-  **Fonts:**  
  Although the Figma design specified "Neue Haas Grotesk Display," I used (`Open Sans`) due to web availability.
